  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequent Asked Questions",
    "question1": {
      "title": "What distinguishes Elyoos from other social networks?",
      "text1": "In most social networks, individual posts such as pictures, texts or videos are posted and grouped with hashtags at most, as for example on Twitter. In Elyoos, these posts are assigned to a question as an answer. This makes it easier for users to find the information relevant to them.",
      "text2": "Another important point is that Elyoos is completely advertising free and is one hundred percent financed by donations. In addition, we focus our content on the goal mentioned in <a href='/vision'>Vision</a>."
    },
    "question2": {
      "title": "What are the most important concepts at Elyoos?",
      "text1": "Question/Answer, Commitment and Trust Circle."
    },
    "question3": {
      "title": "What is a commitment?",
      "text1": "A commitment at Elyoos can be an association, a project, an organisation or your personal commitment to a better world. Commitments are an important part of the platform and can be used as answers to questions. In this way, the user receives important information about who is dealing with a specific question.",
      "text2": "Alice, for example, is interested in the question 'How can zero waste be implemented in everyday life?'. In answer to this question, Bob captured a Zero Waste store near where Alice lives. She now knows where she can shop in order to use less packaging material."
    },
    "question4": {
      "title": "Should I enter commitments that I do not represent?",
      "text1": "No. Commitments should only be recorded by those persons who represent the commitment itself. However, you have the option to send an email generated by Elyoos to a person with a commitment to draw their attention to this platform."
    },
    "question5": {
      "title": "What is a Trust Circle?",
      "text1": "What information we believe has a lot to do with trust. Add people whose opinions you value to your Trust Circle. This allows you to see in your feed when they capture a question, answer questions, agree to answers, and much more. If a lot of people lead you in their Trust Circle, you have a large reach in the network. For example, if you are interested in a question, this means that many people see it in their feed."
    },
    "question6": {
      "title": "How does information spread over the network?",
      "text1": "This works in a similar way to other social networks. Example:",
      "text2": "If a person creates a question, people see this in their feed which have this person in their trust circle.",
      "text3": "If a person finds the question interesting or answers it, the people who have this person in their Trust Circle will see it."
    },
    "question7": {
      "title": "Why are answers up voted?",
      "text1": "Up voting answers should ensure that the most relevant ones appear first. This way you don't have to scroll long until you find the right answers."
    },
    "question8": {
      "title": "Are my questions visible to people without an account?",
      "text1": "When you create a question, it is initially only visible to people with a user account. An administrator of Elyoos will decide whether your question will also become public. In this way, we want to ensure that issues of general interest are visible to the outside world."
    },
    "question9": {
      "title": "What are the advantages of an account?",
      "text1": "An account allows you to create questions, answers and commitments. In addition, you keep up to date with which topics the people you know deal with. This way you can also see questions that are not visible without a user account.  Another important advantage is that you can filter the answers to a question by your trust circle. You'll learn how the people you trust think about a topic. "
    },
    "question10": {
      "title": "Is my profile visible to non-members?",
      "text1": "Your profile is only visible to people without accounts and search engines if you allow this in the privacy setting."
    },
    "question11": {
      "title": "How is the platform financed?",
      "text1": "The development and operation of the platform is financed 100 percent by donations."
    },
    "question12": {
      "title": "Is the code of Elyoos open source?",
      "text1": "Yes, to provide a better transparency regarding the algorithms used, the code is open source. This can be viewed at <a href='https://github.com/Elyoos/Elyoos' target='_blank'>Github</a>."
