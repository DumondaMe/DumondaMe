      "title": "What distinguishes DumondaMe from other social networks?",
      "text1": "In most social networks, individual posts such as pictures, texts or videos are posted and grouped with hashtags at most, as for example on Twitter. In DumondaMe, these posts are assigned to a question as an answer.",
      "text2": "Another important point is that DumondaMe is completely advertising free and is one hundred percent financed by donations. In addition, we focus our content on the goal mentioned in <a href='/vision'>Vision</a>."

      "title": "What are the most important concepts at DumondaMe?",

      "text1": "A commitment at DumondaMe can be an association, a project, an organisation or your personal commitment to a better world. Commitments are an important part of the platform and can be used as answers to questions. In this way, the user receives important information about who is dealing with a specific question.",
      "text2": "Alice, for example, is interested in the question 'How can zero waste be implemented in everyday life?'. In answer to this question, Bob captured a Zero Waste store near where Alice lives. She now knows where she can shop in order to use less packaging material."
    },
    "question4": {
      "title": "Should I create commitments that I do not represent?",
      "text1": "No. Commitments should only be recorded by those persons who represent the commitment itself. However, you have the option to send an email generated by DumondaMe to a person with a commitment to draw their attention to this platform."
    },
    "question5": {
      "title": "What is a Trust Circle?",
      "text1": "What information we believe has a lot to do with trust. Add people whose opinions you value to your Trust Circle. This allows you to see in your feed when they capture a question, answer questions, agree to answers, and much more."
    },
    "question6": {
      "title": "Why are answers up voted?",

    "question7": {
      "title": "Are my questions visible to people without an account?",

    },
    "question8": {
      "title": "What are the advantages of an account?",
