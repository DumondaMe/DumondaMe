# DumondaMe

How do we change the world into a place where a sustainable approach to nature, social justice, a high quality of life and peace are as self-evident as the air we breathe? In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ask the necessary questions and implement the appropriate answers. This requires commitment in various areas such as environmental protection, the economy,  education and many more.

DumondaMe serves as a catalyst, which makes the already existing solutions visible and supports the development of new ones. The social network uses the potential of the Internet to enable a paradigm shift by joining forces. One that no longer lets us only dream of a better future, but brings it into the present.
